			use = <"Use to record subject responses to hearing screening for one ear at a time or both ears simultaneously.

Use to record the outcome of all responses to hearing screening (or Screening Outcome). 

This archetype has been designed to capture screening assessment for hearing, using pass/fail criteria, for the following tests:
- Pure Tone Audiometry;
- Play Audiometry;
- Automated Auditory Brainstem Response; and
- Visual Reinforcement Orientation Audiometry.

All of the data elements are recorded using a single method or protocol. If, during the test, any of the protocol parameters need to be modified, then the subsequent part of the test will need to be recorded within a separate instance of the test data, using the updated protocol parameters.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used for hearing threshold assessment - use the OBSERVATION.audiogram archetype.

Not to be used to record other auditory assessments such as:
- Behavioural Observation Audiometry (BOA);
- Most Comfortable Listening Level (MCL) and Uncomfortable Listening Level (UCL); and
- Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) for diagnostic purposes.
These assessments need to be recorded in specific archetypes for the purpose.">
