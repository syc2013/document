Use the related CLUSTER archetypes - for example, CLUSTER.tympanogram and CLUSTER.pinna - to record detailed examination findings of specific aspects of the physical examination and findings for a specific ear.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.

Use as a container archetype - to provide a common, queryable ENTRY archetype in which specific, detailed CLUSTER examination archetypes can be nested.">

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations or measurements - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure, OBSERVATION.body_weight, or OBSERVATION.height.">
